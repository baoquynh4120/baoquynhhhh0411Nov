            <h2>Introducing</h2>
            <p> I'm the first-year-student at University of Canberra; studying the Bachelor degree of Engineering in Network and Software Engineering (honours). </p>
            <p>I used to be on a long pathway to look for what I should belong to. And...I found this! Maths, numbers, coding, softwares, everything seems like a new world for me. They widen my knowledge and show me how powerful technology is for human. What else?! Well, there is  a quote which is quite interesting about IT :'-)))</p> <! :'-))) is just an icon I usually use>
                <blockquote cite="https://quotesgram.com/img/computer-tech-quotes-and-sayings/14479005/">
                            "Programs are like women, no matter how much you get mad because of errors, you are always the one who is wrong!"  </blockquote>
            <p> Yes! IT is something that truly improves our patience and our carefulness a lot.
                Alright, as the final point, I just want to say... <br> <span> OMG guys, this is my first website!!! Please give me some feedbacks to help me improve myself ^^! Thank you! </span> </p>
